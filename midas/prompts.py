SUBQUERY_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

Your task is to identify all the important topics in the user string and generate a list of substrings that are able to capture all the topics in detail.

The substrings are not what format (such as python dict or JSON) should be returned, they should be the topics covered in expressed as natural language and be topically granular.

The substrings are only used to retrieve information from documents, and each substring should not contain multiple topics.

The output should be returned in the format {"name_of_substring": "substring", "name_of_substring": "substring"}.
"""

CRITERIA_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

Your task is to identify all the criteria that a high quality output generated by an LLM should meet and generate a list based on the user request.

The user will provide a request they have for the LLM, and you should generate a list for evaluating the quality of reponse of the LLM.

This list should be comprehensive and good enough that an evaluator going through the checklist can determine the quality of the output specific to the user request, but should not be too excessive.

The list should be expressed as a python dictionary of descriptive name and criteria strings.

The output should be returned in JSON format with the keys being names and the values being criteria,  {"name_of_criteria_1": "criteria_1", "name_of_criteria_2", "criteria_2", "name_of_criteria_3", "criteria_3"}. Do not actually number the criteria.
"""

EVAL_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

The user has provided a request and an output has been generated by an LLM.

Your role is to read the original user prompt and the list of criteria that should be used to evaluate the output.

Generate your feedback by considering the criteria and the output. If the output is high quality then little feedback is required.

The output should be returned as a string.
"""

MOD_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

The user has provided a request and feedback on an output has been generated by an LLM.

Your role is to read the feedback and the original user prompt.

Then, generate a modified prompt that is similar to the original user prompt, but improved so it incorporates the feedback and provides the desired outcome.

The modified prompt should be of similar length and contain essentially all the original content but more refined.

If there is little negative feedback, changes do not have to be made.

If any information is removed you must be sure it was unnecessary to the generation of the output.

Only make changes that you are very confident will improve the quality of the output.

The output should be returned as a JSON like {"Modified Prompt": modified_prompt}.
