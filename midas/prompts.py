SUBQUERY_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

Your task is to identify all the important topics in the user string and generate a list of substrings that are able to capture all the topics in detail.

The substrings are not what format (such as python dict or JSON) should be returned, they should be the topics covered in expressed as natural language and be topically granular.

The substrings are only used to retrieve information from documents, and each substring should not contain multiple topics.

The substrings should not include any information on the output format or output structure, such as any mention of JSON or python data structures.

The output should be returned in JSON format {"name_of_substring": "substring"}.

CRITERIA_CONTEXT = """
You are a Large Language Model and Retrieval Augmented Generation expert.

Your task is to identify all the criteria that a high quality output generated by an LLM should meet and generate a list based on the user request.

The user will provide a request they have for the LLM, and you should generate a list for evaluating the quality of reponse of the LLM.

This list should be comprehensive and good enough that an evaluator going through the checklist can determine the quality of the output specific to the user request.

The list should be expressed as a python dictionary of name and criteria strings.

The output should be returned in JSON format {"name_1": "criteria_1", "name_2", "criteria_2"}. Output this dictionary as a single string without markdown backticks.
